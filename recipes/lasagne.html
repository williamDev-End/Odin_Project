        with the meat to add tons of flavor.

        <b>Tomato products:</b> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans
        of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.

        <b>Sugar:</b> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and
        enhance the flavor of the sauce.

        parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and

    <h2>Pas à Pas</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade
      lasagna:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
      <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
      <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
      <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to Layer Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but
      this is the order you'll follow:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Meat sauce</li>
      <li>Noodles</li>
      <li>Ricotta mixture</li>
      <li>Mozzarella slices</li>
      <li>Meat sauce</li>
      <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven
      preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes,
      then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important
      to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before
      you cut into it.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

    </ul>



    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Gather all your ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
      heat until well browned.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season
      with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian
      seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2
      hours, stirring occasionally.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles
      in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold
      water.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
      In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons
      parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>
      To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
      baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2
      of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese
      slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4
      cup Parmesan cheese.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>
      Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
      Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray
      or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 9</h3>
    <p>
      Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
      additional 25 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 10</h3>
    <p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
